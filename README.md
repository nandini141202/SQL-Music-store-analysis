# SQL-Music-store-analysis
Repository Description: SQL Music Store Analysis üéµüìä
This project focuses on analyzing a music store database using SQL to derive insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and music trends. The analysis is performed using SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and visualize data.

Key Features:
1. Data Exploration üîç
-Understanding the structure of the database (tables, relationships, primary & foreign keys).
-Extracting information about customers, artists, albums, genres, and purchases.
-Identifying trends in sales, customer preferences, and top-selling artist
-Querying metadata such as most popular genres, highest revenue-generating artists, and top-selling albums.

2. Complex Queries & Data Analysis üõ†Ô∏è
Using SQL Joins to merge data across multiple tables (e.g., linking customers to their purchases, tracking artist sales).
-Implementing Aggregate Functions (SUM(), AVG(), COUNT()) to compute revenue, sales counts, and customer engagement.
-Utilizing Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down complex queries for better readability and efficiency.
-Applying Window Functions (RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()) to analyze top artists, customers, and sales trends over time.

3. Performance Optimization & Best Practices ‚ö°
-Implementing Indexing on high-frequency columns to speed up query performance.
-Normalizing the database to avoid redundancy and improve consistency.
-Writing optimized SQL queries using best practices like avoiding unnecessary SELECT * and reducing redundant joins.--
-Analyzing query execution plans to enhance performance and reduce query run-time.
